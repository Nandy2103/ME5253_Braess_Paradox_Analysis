This repository contains two .ipynb files. reproduction.ipynb is the notebook that reproduces the results of the original paper "UAV Swarm Cooperative Target Search: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach"

ELFES.ipynb is the notebook which integrates the sensor model change.

It is recommended that this be opened in google colab. 

Kindly run the following commands in the notebook before executing any code:

```
pip install gymnasium
```
```
pip install torch
```
Note that it will take a long time for the training to finish so we recommend that you change Runtime Type to T4-GPU.

Now, run the training code first, then the simulation code. These should occur in sequential order.

In the event that the files do not work, links to the notebook have been provided (view access, no chnages will be saved)
